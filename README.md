## Rummikub (Game) Timer
A game timer with start, pause, and stop controls that continually restarts a timer. When time runs out and a player's turn is over, the timer begins again for the next player's turn. The background color changes as time runs out. Set your preferred turn length of 15, 30, 45 or 60 seconds. This nugget is designed for an iPhone X. If you are using a computer web browser, you may want to adjust the window size for a better display.

## Settlers (Game) Timer
Track how long each player spends on their turn throughout a game. Enter the name of each of your players in the order that they will play in the game. Click/tap 'create game' to generate a new game. Use the start and stop controls to monitor when the clock is running. Use the 'next turn' button to change the player using time. If using a desktop or external keyboard, the spacebar should active the next turn.
